              Why Keep a To-Do List? ðŸ¤”?

              By keeping such a list, you make sure that your tasks are written
              down all in one place so you don't forget anything important. And
              by prioritizing tasks, you plan the order in which you'll do them,
              so that you can tell what needs your immediate attention, and what
              you can leave until later.Writing your daily tasks on a list can
              help you increase productivity and decrease stress. To-do lists
              enable you to segment your goals into achievable activities and
              complete large projects by breaking them into smaller assignments.
              Recording tasks can allow you to better manage your time and
              encourages you to achieve more throughout your day.
